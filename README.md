# -The-Power-of-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-
An advanced form of neural network called a CNN is made specifically to analyse grid-like input, such as image and videos, with extraordinary efficiency. Convolutional layers, which distinguish CNNs from conventional neural networks, allow them to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of characteristics from input data.
